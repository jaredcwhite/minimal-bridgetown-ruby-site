# Minimal Bridgetown Repo with Ruby-only Pages

**[DEMO SITE]()**

No `.html`, `.md`, `.liquid`, `.erb`, etc. Only pure `.rb` files for everything.

Is this the way you should build a website? Probably not! But as a fun experiment, it's pretty rad.

Requires the **resource** content engine configured and latest release of [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) v0.21 or higher.
